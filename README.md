Hi, I’m Mark.

I’m a data engineer and applied machine learning practitioner focused on building
reproducible data pipelines and evaluation-driven ML systems.

My work spans wearable health data, model comparison and validation, and
biomedical ML, with experience working with real-world datasets (e.g., ADNI).

Selected work:
- Wearable data pipeline (local-first ingestion, dbt transformations, CI)

- Model comparison and evaluation experiments

- Alzheimer’s disease imaging / ADNI research project
